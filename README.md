The Online Store Management System is a simple application designed to manage an online store's core functions. It includes features for:

Product Management: Keep track of product details, stock levels, and handle product quantities.
Customer Management: Record customer details and track their order history.
Order Management: Create and manage orders with multiple products, apply discounts, and calculate totals.
Payment Processing: Handle payments through different methods and confirm successful transactions.
The system simulates a basic online store where customers can place orders, apply discounts, and make payments, while the store tracks inventory and customer purchases.
